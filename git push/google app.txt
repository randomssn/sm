python+google app engine

https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/introduction



the steps I followed to get GAE 1.7.1 working on Ubuntu 
open a terminal Ctr-t and make sure you are in the home directory.
create a project folder. (I used google_projects)
cd into the project folder
download GAE 1.7.1
unzip the file
delete the zip. (optional)
Here are the terminal commands for the steps above:

    cd ~
    mkdir google_projects
    cd google_projects
    wget -O gae.zip http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/google_appengine_1.7.1.zip
    unzip gae.zip
    rm gae.zip
Now its time to create the project and start the development server.

    cp -r google_appengine/new_project_template testapp
    python google_appengine/dev_appserver.py testapp


or( to change the port number
    
 python google_appengine/dev_appserver.py --port 8000 testapp
then localhost:8000  will display Hello World)
 
The first line simply copies and renames the new_project_template folder into google_proects as testapp. The last line starts the development server. You can stop it with Ctr-C.

With the development server up and running you can view testapp at localhost:8080. You should see "Hello world!".
