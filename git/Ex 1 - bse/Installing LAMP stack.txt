Step 1: First sudo -i

Step 2: Then run
		apt-get update
		apt-get upgrade

Step 3: Next we shall install Apache, so run the following command:
		apt-get install apache2

Step 4: Apache will be downloaded and installed. However, it would not start, reason being as follows:

"apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName"

Step 5: To resolve this issue, we need to create a file called "fqdn" which stands for Fully Qualified Domain Name with the following content. Make sure you start the text editor with root access and save the file into /etc/apache2/conf.d/
		
"ServerName localhost"

or simply execute the following command:

echo "ServerName localhost" | tee /etc/apache2/conf.d/fqdn

Step 6: By default, Apache points to a website located in /var/www/index.html. We need Apache to point to our own website folder which might be somwhere else,say "home/dv/website". In order to do so we need create a new configuration file for this website and make Apache use that file for its usage. Follow the following steps for it:

1) First, make a copy of the default file located under "/etc/apache2/sites-available" and save it as say "site1"

2) Next, Change DocumentRoot "/var/www" to DocumentRoot "/home/dv/website"

3) Then, Change <Directory /var/www/> to <Directory /home/dv/website/>. Save and Exit the file.

Step 7: Now, we need to disable the default setting using the following command

	a2dissite default

Then, make active the new site using

	a2ensite site1

Step 8: Finally, restart apache.
